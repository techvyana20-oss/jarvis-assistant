## ‚ö° Notes

* Ensure `termux-api` is installed if you plan to open URLs via `termux-open-url`.
* Internet connection is required for commands like `weather`, `joke`, and `news`.
* You can edit the script to add more commands and features.

```

I can also create a **version with emojis and colors in the terminal** instructions to make it look more ‚Äúfancy‚Äù in Termux. Do you want me to do that?
